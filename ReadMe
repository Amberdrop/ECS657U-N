How to Play:
At the menu page, player can click on the Intro to understand the premise of the game and watch the storyline unfold. From there, player will be initiated into level 1, where they start off in a ship and has to go into the planet in search of four diary entries that have been left there by a previous inhabitant. They have to use the clues in the diary entries to figure out the 4-digit code to shut down the robot enemies seeking to kill them.  Along the way, there are upgrades player can collect to help them win the game. Player will die if they run into an enemy or go into the water without the right upgrade. 

Good Luck! 

Use WASD or arrow keys to move forward, backward, left, right.
