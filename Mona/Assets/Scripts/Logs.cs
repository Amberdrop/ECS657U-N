//     Finally landed on our new home - been awake now for around 3 hours - cryosleep really does a number on your knees!
//     Still, better than spending 3 years sitting around on a cramped ship. I can't believe we are finally here.
//     The planet is beautiful - full of grass and trees (Real trees! I havn't seen those since I was just a kid!).
//     The island we are one is big enough for our plans, and we still have the terraaformer if we need to expand, and the new state-of0+-the-art drones in orbit, ready to keep us happy and healthy no matter what!
//     Guess it's time to go meet my new neighbours!

//     All going well. Been getting along with the rest of the settelers well - V and I have struck up a friendship, and there havn't been any big fights. 
//     Only event of not was K breaking her leg, but we have a doctor and some medical supplies, and we have sent for a medical drone to come down from orbit to help.
//     Should be here in the next couple of days.

//     We havn't heard from K for the last 3 days. She was doing well, seemed to be in good spirits, but when the drone came down it insisted we lock her into the old storage cupboard on the little island in the North, and told up they were not to be disturbed. 
//     There isn't any food or water in there, and neither of them have come out. We havn't heard anything. I'm beginning to worry.

//     K is dead. The medical drone finally came out and told us. It won't say how, and it won't let the doctor, P, in to check the body. She was absolutely fine, and a broken leg is basically nothing to the meds even we have in the med kit.
//     I don't trust the drones. I need to find out whats in the storage shed, what the drones are up to. I know the control center for them is in there. I foud the code - its 9427. That should let me in. Wish me luck.

//     If anyone finds these logs, it means I failed. Please - destroy the drones before they can do any more harm.
